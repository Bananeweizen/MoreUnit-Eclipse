	<h1>Class decoration</h1>
	Class decoration is implemented very simply. Based on the settings (testcase 
	prefixes and suffixes) moreUnit tries to find a matching class in the underlying 
	project. If "Test" is one of your testcase suffixes (the default setting
	on installtion) for example Foo gets marked with a small green icon in the 
	package explorer if a class named FooTest exists in the underlying project.<br>
	Decoration is disabled by default. You have to enable label decoration via 
	WINDOW &rarr; PREFERENCES... &rarr; APPEARANCE &rarr; LABEL DECORATIONS &rarr; Decorate Classes with TestCase. 
	<h1>Method markers in the editor </h1>
	To enable markers for tested methods in the editor you have to choose the "Add marker for tested
	methods"-menu from a popup-menu of a project in the package explorer. It causes a scan of
	all your Java projects and adds markers in the open editors. You have to choose this 
	menu-option once after installing the plugin. If you have changed your preferences you 
	should start a rescan for markers. 	
	<h1>Jump to test</h1>
	From java files which are open in the editor you can jump to the corresponding testcase
	via the popupmenu of the editor or via the shortcut "Ctrl"+"J". moreUnit identifies the 
	name of the class under the cursor position. To find the coresponding testcase the prefixes
	and suffixes from the preferences are used. If exactly one testcase is found the file gets
	opened. If more than one testcase is found a dialog is shown and the user can chose which 
	testcase he wants to work on. If no testcase is found, the testcase creation wizard
    is shown initialized with settings from the preference page.<br>
	moreUnit tries to identify the corresponding testmethod of the actual cursor position 
	and jumps to the method signature of the test case.<br>
	Example: For a method named "addTree" tests named "testAddTree" or "testAddTreeSUFFIX"
	will be detected as testmethod.
	<h1> Generate test</h1>
	To generate a test-method stub choose "Generate Test" from the popupmenu within an editor. 
	moreUnit identifies the method under cursor position and generates a testmethod stub. 
	At first, moreUnit tries to find a testcase for the underlying resource (if you want to know 
	how this is done, take a look above at "Jump to test"). If no testcase is found the testcase 
	wizard is shown. If the method under cursor position is named "amethodname" the generated 
	test method will be name "testAmethodname". If moreUnit detects a testmethod with this name 
	no method stub is generated. moreUnit doesn't jump to the testmethod automatically so you 
	have to jump to the testcase if you want to edit it.<br>
	The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If you want to change the 
	default keys go to WINDOW &rarr; PREFERENCES... &rarr; GENERAL &rarr; KEYS and change the 
	settings of the commands named "CreateTestMethod" and "JumpToTest". 	
	<h1>Refactoring support</h1>
	moreUnit offers some refactoring support. If you rename a class and a corresponding 
	testcase exists, moreUnit will include a rename refactoring for the test class.
    For methods there is a similar behaviour. If you rename a 
	method with one or more corresponding testmethods, a method rename refactoring for each
    test method is added to the rename refactoring.
