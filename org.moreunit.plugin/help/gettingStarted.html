		<h1>Activate Decoration of classes </h1>
		Choose WINDOW &rarr; PREFERENCES &rarr; APPEARANCE &rarr; LABEL DECORATION 
		and activate "Decorate Classes with TestCase"
		<h1>Enter your global preferences</h1>
		Before you can start you have to configure some preferences.<br>
        If the source folder for your preferences is not named "junit" you have to enter the
        name of your junit source folder.<br>
        By default moreUnit expects your testcases named with suffix "Test". Example class name
        HelloWorld then the testcase should be name HelloWorldTest. If your suffix differs from
        this default you have to enter your default here.<br>
        The second configuration is the prefix and suffix list used for testcases in your project.
        You can have lists to use several different prefixes/suffixes in your project.<br>
        In some projects package prefixes are used (e.g. tests of classes in package com.foo.*
        are saved at test.com.foo.*), which can be configured as well.
        <h1>Enter your project specific preferences (optional)</h1>
        If you have sourced out your tests into another project you have to choose the
        project containing the tests.<br>
        Choose the project from the project explorer, select PROPERTIES from the popupmenu.
        At the MOREUNIT entry you can choose the project containing the tests for the underlying
        project.
		<h1>Scan for marker</h1>
		To see markers for your tested classes within the editors you have to scan only once.
        Choose a java project and select "Add marker for tested methods". After starting all
        projects are scanned.
		<h1>Start coding</h1>
		Configuration is finished. Start coding :) Switch between class/testcase or method/testmethod
        with the shortcut "Ctrl" + "J"
