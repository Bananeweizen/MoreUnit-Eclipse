			<h1>Switching between test and class under test</h1>

			<p>You can jump from java classes which are open in the editor to the corresponding test cases via the contextual menu of the editor or via the
			shortcut <em>Ctrl-J</em>. MoreUnit identifies the name of the class under the cursor. To find the corresponding test case the prefixes and suffixes
			from the preferences are used. If exactly one test case is found the file gets opened. If more than one test case is found a dialog is shown and
			prompts you to choose which test case you want to work on:</p>
			<figure><img src="../../img/dialog.png" width="151" height="103" alt="Test selection wizard" /></figure>

			<p>If no test case is found the test case wizard is shown, initialized with the settings from the preference page:</p>
			<figure><img src="../../img/wizard.png" width="566" height="498" alt="Test creation wizard" /></figure>

			<p>MoreUnit also tries to identify the test method(s) corresponding to the method under the cursor and directly jumps to it if only one is found.
			<br />Example: For a method named "addTree" tests named "testAddTree" or "testAddTreeSUFFIX" will be detected as test method.</p>

			<p>Also, if you activated the extended method search, a test method that calls your method will be found, whatever its name. <br />Finally, please
			note that jumping also works the other way, to go back to your production code.</p>

			<p>The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If you want to change the default keys go to <em>Window &gt; Preferences... &gt;
			General &gt; Keys</em> and change the settings of the commands named "Create Test Method" and "Jump to Test".</p>
