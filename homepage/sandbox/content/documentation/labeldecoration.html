			<h1>Label decoration</h1>
			
			<p>Class decoration is implemented in a very simple way. Based on the settings (test case prefixes and suffixes) MoreUnit tries to find a matching
			class in the underlying project. If for instance "Test" is an element of your test case suffix list (this is the default setting on first
			installation) Foo will be marked with a small green icon in the package explorer if a class named FooTest exists in the underlying project.</p>

			<p>Decoration is disabled by default. You have to enable label decoration via <em>Eclipse|Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; General &gt; Appearance
			&gt; Label Decorations &gt; Decorate Classes with Test Case</em>.</p>
