			<h1>Test case/test method creation</h1>
			<p>To generate a test-method stub choose "Generate Test" from the pop-up menu within an editor. MoreUnit identifies the method under the cursor and
			generates a test method stub. At first MoreUnit tries to find a test case for the underlying resource (if you want to know how this is done, take a
			look above at "Jump to test"). If no test case is found the test case wizard is shown. If the method under the cursor is named "amethodname" the
			generated test method will be name "testAmethodname", assuming you defined "test" as a prefix in MoreUnit preferences. If MoreUnit detects a test
			method with this name no method stub is generated.</p>

			</div>

			<p>MoreUnit doesn't jump to the test method automatically so you have to jump to the test case if you want to edit it.<br>
			The shortcuts for the jump/generate action are configurable. If you want to change the default keys go to <em>Eclipse|Window &gt; Preferences... &gt;
			General &gt; Keys</em> and change the settings of the commands named "Create Test Method" and "Jump to Test".</p>
			<p>If you use the "Generate Test" action on a test method MoreUnit creates a second test method.</p>
