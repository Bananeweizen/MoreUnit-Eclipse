				<h2>My project has more than one test source folder (e.g. unit &amp; functional)?</h2>
				<p>You have to use project specific settings. There you can configure more than one test source folder (this can not be done with the workspace
				settings of MoreUnit).</p>
				
				<h2>I'm getting error messages after installing the plugin.</h2>
				<p>Current versions of MoreUnit do not support Eclipse versions older than 3.4. If you can not switch to a recent version of Eclipse try to
				install older versions of MoreUnit.</p>
