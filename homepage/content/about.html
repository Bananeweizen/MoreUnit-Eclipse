				<h1>The MoreUnit team</h1>
				<p>The project got published on January 2006 by Vera Henneberger (formerly Wahler). Since May 2006 Channing Walton is a member of the project
				as well. He had the same idea for the plugin and published SwitchUnit. We merged both plugins and we work together from now on.	In 2010 Andreas
				Groll and Nicolas Demengel joined the project.</p>
